          <h2>History of Modafinil</h2>
          <p>
            Michel Jouvet, a neurophysiologist professor, in collaboration with
            Lafon Laboratories developed Adrafinil. Tests revealed that the
            newly-founded drug is ‘eugeroic’ in nature which means it has
            potential to promote wakefulness. Adrafinil was put into trials to
            determine its potential in treating narcolepsy but the results were
            satisfactory and this halted the development of a drug.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1976, Modafinil was born as an active metabolite of Adrafinil.
            Unlike its parental drug, Modafinil was found to be exceptionally
            efficient in treating sleepiness caused by narcolepsy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Modafinil is a primary metabolite of Adrafinil. I has similar
            activity to its parental drug but it lacks the polar -OH group on
            the terminal amide group. Modafinil was introduced as a prescription
            medicine under the name Modiodal in 1994. Later, the USA approved
            its usage under the name as Provigil in 1998. In 2003, the US FDA
            approved Modafinil Nootropic for the treatment of sleep apnea and
            shift work sleep disorder.

            <h2>How does Modafinil work?</h2>
            <p>
              Modafinil Nootropic is a racemic mixture of S- and R-enantiomers.
              It is believed that the psychotropic properties possessed by the
              wakefulness promoter agent is due to its R-enantiomer content.
            </p>
            <p>
              The exact mechanism of action of the nootropic is not clear yet.
              However, the working pattern can be decoded with the help of
              findings of various studies and trials ‘conducted to evaluate its
              ability to offer alertness and other benefits. Modafinil is a weak
              inhibitor of dopamine reuptake. Though it has little to no
              affinity towards serotonin or norepinephrine transporters,
              elevated concentrations of these two neurotransmitters can be seen
              in the brain post consumption of Modafinil nootropic. This could
              be because of indirect effect of extracellular dopamine
              concentration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alongside, Modafinil Australia has been assumed to elevate
              signaling in the hypothalamic orexin and histamine
              neurotransmitter pathways. Animal studies have proved that the
              medicine has a glutamatergic effect. Another study have estimated
              that the wakefulness agent shows euphoric effect which in turn
              used to reduce cocaine dependency.
