However, it is vital to consume these medications under\n            medical supervision and for the prescribed period of time.\n          </p>\n          <h3>Can we consume nootropic medicines daily?</h3>\n          <p>\n            Yes. You can consume these medications on a regular basis as long as\n            it is being monitored by your doctor.
